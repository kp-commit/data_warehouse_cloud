### Business Requirement:
- A music streaming company, Sparkify has grown their user base and song database.
- Now, they **want to move their processes and data onto the cloud.** 
- Their data resides in **S3**, 
- in a directory of **JSON logs on user activity** on the app, 
- as well as a directory with **JSON metadata** on the songs in their app.  

### Solution:
- **Data engineering** is required for building an **ETL pipeline** that _extracts_ their data from **S3**, 
- _stages_ them in **Redshift**, and _transforms_ data into a set of _dimensional tables_ for their
- **analytics team** to continue finding _insights_ in what songs their users are listening to. 
- Afterwards, check the database and _ETL pipeline_ by running _queries_ given to you by the analytics team.


### Datasets:
---

Working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each: 

1. Song data: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data ```
2. Log data: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```, Log data JSON metadata: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json``` 

**Song Dataset**

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset. 

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json 
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like:
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
Log


```


**Log Dataset**

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) with activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month.

For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset. 
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```


And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

```
{"artist":"Blue October \/ Imogen Heap","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Kaylee","gender":"F","itemInSession":7,"lastName":"Summers","length":241.3971,"level":"free","location":"Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540344794796.0,"sessionId":139,"song":"Congratulations","status":200,"ts":1541107493796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/35.0.1916.153 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"8"}
```

###  

### Steps taken:
---
#### Setup AWS
1. Setup AWS and update creditinals in config
    - Manually setup an AWS account, obtain key and secret 
    - Set these in configuration file ```dwh.cfg```

#### Create Cluster
2. Build Python script ```create_cluster.py``` to connect to **AWS** and create a **Redshift Cluster**:
    - Use ```Boto3``` to create ```iam```, ```redshift``` clients  
    - Create ```iam role``` for cluster, obtain ```RoleArn```
    - Create a new cluster, obtain ```endpoint``` url
    - Set RoleArn and endpoint in ```dwh.cfg```
    
#### Create Table Schemas
3. Build an ETL pipeline for a **Data Warehosue** hosted on **Redshift Cluster.**
    - Create Table Schemas: Design schemas for your fact and dimension tables.
    - Initiated by ```create_tables.py``` running ```sql_queries.py``` for ```CREATE```, ```DROP```
    - Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
    - Add redshift database and IAM role info to ```dwh.cfg```  

#### Load data to Staging Tables
4. Load data from **S3 to staging tables on Redshift**
    - Implement the logic in ```etl.py``` to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
    - Take care of Duplicates, Transformations and other constraints as needed.
    - Run quick check on database for table counts after insertion. Referenced within calls to ```sql_queries.py```

#### Run Analytics
5. Execute ```analytics.py``` that runs **SQL** queries that analytics team provided to finding _insights_ in what songs their users are listening to. 

#### Delete Cluster 
6. Build ```cluster_delete.py``` that deletes the Redshift cluster. 

###  

### Table Design:
---

### Staging Table: staging_events
##### Note: Columns named to match Log data json file
##### Lowest possible column size taken as possible to maximize storage and processing performace
##### No other major constraints are these are temporary staging tables
```sql
artist VARCHAR,
auth VARCHAR,
firstName VARCHAR,
gender CHAR(1),
itemInSession INTEGER,
lastName VARCHAR,
length FLOAT,
level VARCHAR(10),
location VARCHAR,
method VARCHAR,
page VARCHAR,
registration FLOAT,
sessionId INTEGER,
song VARCHAR,
status INTEGER,
ts TIMESTAMP SORTKEY,
userAgent VARCHAR,
userId INTEGER
```

### Staging Table: staging_songs
##### Note: Columns named to match song data json files
##### Lowest possible column size taken as possible to maximize storage and processing performance
##### No other major constraints are these are temporary staging tables
```sql
num_songs INTEGER,
artist_id VARCHAR,
artist_latitude DECIMAL(10,6),
artist_longitude DECIMAL(10,6),
artist_location VARCHAR,
artist_name VARCHAR,
song_id VARCHAR,
title VARCHAR,
duration DECIMAL,
year INTEGER
```

### Dimension Table: dm_users
##### Lowest possible column size taken as possible to maximize storage and processing performance
##### Assigned DISTKEY on user_id both utilized in many joins as later seen in analytical queries
```sql
user_id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY DISTKEY,
first_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
gender CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
level VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
```
### Dimension Table: dm_songs
##### Note: Assigned DISTKEY on title because of high number of entries (this is the biggest table in set). 
##### SORTKEY on song_id because of ORDER BY on this to minimize shuffling.
```sql
song_id VARCHAR NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY SORTKEY,
title VARCHAR NOT NULL DISTKEY,
artist_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
year INTEGER NOT NULL,
duration DECIMAL
```

### Dimension Table: dm_artists
##### Note: Assigned DISTKEY on title because of high number of entries
##### DISTKEY on name because of number of groupings done on this analytics and this is also 3rd biggest table in set.
```sql
artist_id VARCHAR NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY SORTKEY,
name VARCHAR NOT NULL DISTKEY,
location VARCHAR,
latitude DECIMAL(10,6),
longitude DECIMAL(10,6)
```
### Dimension Table: dm_time
##### Note: Assigned DISTKEY on start_time because similiar start_time can be easily looked up.
##### SORTKEY on weekday because of analytics looking into simliar weekday

```sql
start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY DISTKEY,
hour INTEGER NOT NULL,
day INTEGER NOT NULL,
week INTEGER NOT NULL,
month INTEGER NOT NULL,
year INTEGER NOT NULL,
weekday INTEGER NOT NULL SORTKEY
```

### Fact Table 
##### Note: Assigned DISTKEY and SORTKEY on song_id it is utilized in many joins for lookups and also for ORDER BY
```sql
songplay_id INTEGER IDENTITY(0,1) PRIMARY KEY,
start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
level VARCHAR(10),
song_id VARCHAR NOT NULL DISTKEY SORTKEY,
artist_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
session_id INTEGER,
location VARCHAR,
user_agent VARCHAR
```

### Common Issues and Resolution:

#### 1. Load errors seen through load process
![Load_errors_into_Redshift_from_S3](/images/Load_errors_into_Redshift_from_S3.png)

Resolution: Check ```stl_load_errors``` table for details.
![Load_errors_check4](/images/Load_errors_check4.png)

Found an issue with timestamp earlier during development, addressed with help of stl_load_errors and fixed column to hold epoch properly.
AWS documentation on epoch:
![Load_errors_check4_resolution](/images/Load_errors_check4_resolution.png)

Address by change in COPY statment with epoch:
![Load_errors_check4_resolution1](/images/Load_errors_check4_resolution1.png)


#### 2. AWS errors
![AWS_error](/images/AWS_error.png)
Resolution: Found incorrect COPY statement with creditinals. Addressed with correct usage and resolved.

#### 3. Duplicates
![Analytics_error1_duplicates2](/images/Analytics_error1_duplicates2.png)

Resolution: Modified query for additional grouping sets:
![Analytics_error1_duplicates4](/images/Analytics_error1_duplicates4.png)


#### 4. Python script execution error in Terminal (bad interpreter^M)
![cluster_status_bad_interpreter_error_cluster_status](/images/cluster_status_bad_interpreter_error_cluster_status.png)
File contained extra encoding for carriage returns '\r'.

Resolution: used tr to remove extra encoding:
```tr -d '\r' < filename.py > newfile.py && mv newfile.py filename.py && chmod +x filename.py```
